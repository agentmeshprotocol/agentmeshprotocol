### Style Guides

#### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Use conventional commits format:
  * `feat:` - New feature
  * `fix:` - Bug fix
  * `docs:` - Documentation changes
  * `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  * `refactor:` - Code refactoring
  * `test:` - Test additions or modifications
  * `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes

#### Python Style Guide

* Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
* Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
* Use [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting
* Use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking
* Write docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules
* Use type hints for all function signatures

#### Documentation Style Guide

* Use Markdown for documentation
* Reference functions and classes in backticks: `Agent.connect()`
* Include code examples for new features
* Keep line length to 80 characters where possible
* Use clear, concise language

### Testing

* Write tests for all new functionality
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for >90% code coverage
* Include both unit tests and integration tests
* Test edge cases and error conditions

Example test structure:
```python
import pytest
from amp import Agent, AmpError

class TestAgent:
    def test_agent_creation(self):
        agent = Agent(name="Test Agent")
        assert agent.name == "Test Agent"
        assert agent.id is not None
    
    def test_invalid_capability(self):
        with pytest.raises(AmpError):
            Agent(name="Test", capabilities=["invalid"])
    
    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_connection(self):
        agent = Agent(name="Test Agent")
        await agent.connect("amp://test.local")
        assert agent.is_connected
```

### Documentation

* Update documentation for any changed functionality
* Add docstrings to new functions and classes
* Update the README if adding new features
* Add examples for new capabilities
* Keep API documentation in sync

### Releasing

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create a pull request with release notes
4. After merge, tag the release: `git tag v1.2.3`
5. Push tags: `git push --tags`
6. GitHub Actions will handle the rest
